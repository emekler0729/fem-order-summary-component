## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### Removing Default Space Below Image

To avoid having a small margin below an image that is inside of a wrapping element, make the image `display: block` instead of the default `display: inline-block`.

### Continued development

While I was able to add a basic box-shadow to the call-to-action button and the card element, I felt that my box-shadow was not as refined as the design example. I researched and used box-shadows examples that I found on the internet (documented below). For future development, I will study design best practices for box-shadows.

### Useful resources

- [Smoother Box Shadows](https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/layered-smooth-box-shadows/) - This helped me improve the appearance of my box-shadows on the call-to-action button and card components.
